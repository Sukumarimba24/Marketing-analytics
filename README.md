# Marketing-analytics

**About the dataset:**
This dataset contains details from bank's direct marketing campaigns (telephone calls). The main goal of these calls was to get customers to sign up for a "term deposit" (a type of savings account). It tracks over 41,000 interactions, recording customer details, the timing of the calls, and whether the customer eventually said "yes" or "no."

**Coclusion:**
The dataset shows a low-to-moderate conversion rate, typical for cold-calling marketing. While the bank is reaching a professional and educated demographic, the high number of "no" responses suggests that the marketing strategy might benefit from better targeting—focusing on specific customer segments or timing calls more effectively to increase the 11% success rate.
